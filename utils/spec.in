%description
The Common OCR Service Interface.COSI is an API that allows developpers
and integrators to easily bring OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
capabilities to image processing applications.
COSI makes it easy to interface to existing OCR tools such as Tesseract or GOCR.
The COSI utilities allows to test OCR agents by sending them COSI requests to
decode some regions of a PNG image file.
